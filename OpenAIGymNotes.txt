OpenAI Gym - Its a simulated environment where agents can interact with the environment: view state, take action,  receive reward for action. Its a consistent way for RL algorithms to interact with the environment


Key Points About Each Function:

init:

Runs once when environment is created
Must define the possible actions and observations
Sets up any needed variables or state


reset:

Runs at start of each episode
Must return initial state that matches observation_space
Important for training multiple episodes
Can handle random seeding for reproducibility


step:

Core function that runs environment simulation
Must validate actions are legal
Updates environment state based on action
Calculates rewards
Determines if episode is complete
Most complex function typically


render:

Optional but useful for debugging/visualization
Can support multiple modes
Doesn't affect environment state
Used mainly for human observation/debugging
